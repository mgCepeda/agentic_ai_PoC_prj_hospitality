"""
FastAPI application for hosting a WebSocket-based chat interface.

This module provides a FastAPI application that serves as a WebSocket server for real-time
communication. It includes endpoints for serving the main web interface
and handling WebSocket connections for chat interactions.

Exercise 0 Implementation:
- Uses LangChain agent with file context (3 hotels sample)
- Falls back to hardcoded responses if agent is unavailable
- Integrates with WebSocket API for real-time chat
