## 🎓 Workshop Exercise Plans

### Exercise 0: Simple Agentic Assistant with File Context

#### Phase 1: Setup & Data Preparation
- [ ] Install LangChain dependencies (`langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`)
- [ ] Configure Google Gemini API key as environment variable (`AI_AGENTIC_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Generate synthetic hotel data (3 hotels) using `gen_synthetic_hotels.py`
- [ ] Verify hotel files are created in `bookings-db/output_files/hotels/`

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Create function to load hotel JSON file (`hotels.json`)
- [ ] Create function to load hotel details markdown (`hotel_details.md`)
- [ ] Implement `answer_hotel_question()` function with file context
- [ ] Create ChatPromptTemplate with system prompt for hotel assistant
- [ ] Build LangChain chain (prompt template + LLM)

#### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Create `handle_hotel_query_simple()` async function for WebSocket API
- [ ] Test with basic queries (hotel names, addresses, locations)
- [ ] Test with meal plan queries
- [ ] Test with room information queries
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Add code comments and docstrings
- [ ] Test integration with WebSocket API endpoint
- [ ] Verify responses are properly formatted

### Exercise 1: Hotel Details with RAG

#### Phase 1: Setup & Data Preparation
- [ ] Install RAG dependencies (`langchain-community`, `chromadb`)
- [ ] Generate full hotel dataset (50 hotels) using `gen_synthetic_hotels.py`
- [ ] Verify all hotel files are created (JSON, markdown files)

#### Phase 2: Vector Store Creation
- [ ] Implement document loader for `hotels.json` (JSONLoader)
- [ ] Implement document loader for `hotel_details.md` (TextLoader)
- [ ] Implement document loader for `hotel_rooms.md` (TextLoader)
- [ ] Configure RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (chunk_size=1000, overlap=200)
- [ ] Create GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings instance
- [ ] Build ChromaDB vector store from all documents
- [ ] Persist vector store to disk for reuse

#### Phase 3: RAG Chain Implementation
- [ ] Create ChatGoogleGenerativeAI LLM instance (gemini-2.5-flash-lite, temperature=0)
- [ ] Implement RetrievalQA chain with vector store
- [ ] Design system prompt for hotel assistant context
- [ ] Configure retrieval parameters (k=5 documents)
- [ ] Test retrieval quality with sample queries

#### Phase 4: Agent Implementation
- [ ] Create hotel details agent function
- [ ] Implement query preprocessing (normalization, validation)
- [ ] Add response formatting (markdown structure)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no results, ambiguous queries)

#### Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate RAG agent with WebSocket API
- [ ] Test with hotel location queries
- [ ] Test with meal plan and pricing queries
- [ ] Test with room comparison queries
- [ ] Verify performance (response time < 10s)
- [ ] Compare results with Exercise 0 (should be more accurate)

#### Phase 6: Optimization
- [ ] Tune chunk size and overlap if needed
- [ ] Optimize retrieval k parameter
- [ ] Add caching for frequent queries (optional)
- [ ] Document vector store persistence strategy

### Exercise 2: Booking Analytics with SQL Agent

#### Phase 1: Setup & Database Connection
- [ ] Start PostgreSQL database using `./start-app.sh --no_ai_agent`
- [ ] Install SQL dependencies (`langchain-community`, `psycopg2-binary`)
- [ ] Verify database connection (test connection string)
- [ ] Inspect database schema and understand table structure
- [ ] Load sample booking data to test queries

#### Phase 2: SQL Database Integration
- [ ] Create SQLDatabase instance from connection URI
- [ ] Test basic SQL queries manually (SELECT, COUNT, SUM)
- [ ] Verify database schema introspection works
- [ ] Test date filtering and aggregation queries

#### Phase 3: SQL Agent Implementation
- [ ] Create SQLDatabaseToolkit with database and LLM
- [ ] Implement create_sql_agent with proper system prompt
- [ ] Configure agent for hospitality context (hotel names, dates, metrics)
- [ ] Add custom system prompt explaining booking schema
- [ ] Test agent with simple queries (booking counts)

#### Phase 4: Analytics Calculations
- [ ] Implement bookings count query logic
- [ ] Implement occupancy rate calculation (two-step: query + formula)
- [ ] Implement total revenue aggregation
- [ ] Implement RevPAR calculation (revenue / available room-nights)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (no bookings, division by zero)

#### Phase 5: Two-Step Query Process
- [ ] Implement Step 1: Generate SQL from natural language
- [ ] Implement Step 2: Execute query and format results
- [ ] Add query validation before execution
- [ ] Implement result formatting (tables, markdown)
- [ ] Add error handling for SQL syntax errors

#### Phase 6: Advanced Queries & Testing
- [ ] Test with date range queries (months, quarters, years)
- [ ] Test with hotel-specific filters
- [ ] Test with guest country/city filters
- [ ] Test with meal plan comparisons
- [ ] Verify occupancy and RevPAR calculations are accurate
- [ ] Test with edge cases (empty results, invalid dates)

#### Phase 7: Integration & Error Handling
- [ ] Integrate SQL agent with WebSocket API
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling (connection errors, query errors)
- [ ] Implement query timeout protection
- [ ] Add logging for debugging SQL generation
- [ ] Test end-to-end with WebSocket interface

#### Phase 8: Optimization & Documentation
